## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2019.x or above.
- Your PC must meet the minimum requirements to run Unity, found [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements).
- OpenMaze has been extensively tested on Mac OSX and Windows 10; however, the project should still behave normally on 
  most Linux distros.

### Installation
To use this software in your experiments you will need to download the
following software packages: **Unity, Open Maze, Sublime Text/Text editor of choice**.

1. Download and Install the Unity Hub
   1. Go to: https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal.
   2. Follow Installation instructions for your specific computer.
   3. Open the Unity application and create an account or login.

2. Download Open Maze Software
   1. Go to https://github.com/DuncanLab/OpenMaze (you're already here!).
   2. In the grey dropdown on the left side of the page called 'branch' make sure
      that **master** is selected. Alternatively, checkout the [releases section](https://github.com/DuncanLab/OpenMaze/releases)
      for the latest release.
   3. Now, click the green button on the right hand side called **Clone or
      Download** and make sure to select **Download ZIP**.
   4. Unzip the file you downloaded in an easy to access place. For example, your
      desktop.

3. Download and Install Sublime Text:

   > Please note, if you already have a text editor on your computer that is
   > compatible with .json and .py files you can choose to skip this step and use
   > the text editor you are most comfortable with.

   1. Go to https://www.sublimetext.com/3
   2. Follow the instruction and select the correct download for your computer.

4. Set up Unity with Open Maze
   1. Open the Unity Hub application.
   2. If you have not done so already, please log in or create a free account.
   3. Once signed in, click **Open** near the top right of the window.
   4. Navigate to and select the entire folder that you just unzipped and placed
      in an easy to access place. This folder should be titled
      **OpenMaze-Release**. Select the folder and click **Open**.
   5. Once the OpenMaze project has been loaded into the Unity Hub click the small 
      yellow triangle below the project. This will create a propmt at the bottom
      of the screen to install the appropriate Unity version. Click install (NOTE:
      installing Unity takes longer than you may expect - be patient!)
   6. Once installed click the back arrow in the top left of the Unity hub window.
      You will now see the Unity Version code has been added beside the OpenMaze
      project and the yellow triangle no longer appears. 
   7. Click the project to Open it in Unity. If prompted to update Unity to the 
      newest version click no. 
   8. Once OpenMaze is loaded in Unity Editor navigate to the Asset Store tab at the
      top of the screen beside the Scene tab. 
   9. Download and import "Standard Assets (Unity 2017.3)" and "Nature Startert Kit 2"
      You can find these by searching for them by name.

Congratulations! You have set up the Open Maze project. To begin using the
